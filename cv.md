## Employment History 

<!---
November 2023 - present: Part-time AI Consultant at aiXplain. I conducted a feasibility study for designing smart electronic devices using reinforcement learning solutions.
-->

**August 2022 - December 2023:** Applied Research Scientist in Machine Learning at Personalization Team, Byju's AI LAB 
   - Utilizing transformer-based models, optimal experiment design, and reinforcement learning algorithms, I  developed the technology for estimating students' knowledge levels and providing targeted curriculum recommendations;
   - I leveraged language models to build mathematical reasoning systems and fine-tuned these systems using imitation and reinforcement learning.

**June 2019 - August 2022:** Senior Research Scientist in Machine Learning at Reinforcement Learning Team, Huawei R&D UK 
- I led the autonomous driving projects, focusing on designing low-level controllers and the trajectory planner. As a result of these efforts, the planner's comfort metric was improved by 3%, and a patent application was submitted;
- I established and led a research program to explore new safe reinforcement learning algorithms, which resulted in publications in prestigious conferences such as ICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS, as well as a patent application;
- I provided expert advice on biomedical and computer vision projects, including "Antibody design using reinforcement learning" and "Stabilizing recurrent low-level vision models", which resulted in a patent and scientific publications;
- *Awards:* 2020 "Huawei Future Star Award", the 2021 "Timely Award" as part of a team responsible for delivering autonomous vehicle solutions and publishing scientific papers, and the 2022 "Timely Award" for outstanding individual research.

**September 2016 - June 2019:** Senior Research Associate at Control Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford.
 - I designed biological devices such as filters and feedback controllers and developed fast semidefinite optimization methods resulting in publications in high-profile venues;
 - I was a finalist for the best paper award in Control Systems Letters 2018;
 - Mentored and supervised students. 

**October 2014 - September 2016:** F.R.S.-- FNRS Fellow. Liege University, Belgium;
 - I designed a research program entitled  ``Analysis and Control of Biological Systems'';
 - I developed data-based analysis and control methods for biological systems;
 - Mentored and supervised students.

**June 2012 - October 2014:** Research Associate. Imperial College London
 - Designed identification and reinforcement learning methods for biological systems;
 - Mentored and supervised students.
